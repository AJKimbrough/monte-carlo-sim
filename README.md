# Monte Carlo Option Pricing Simulator

An interactive Streamlit-based web application to simulate and price European options using Monte Carlo methods and compare the results with the Black-Scholes analytical model. This dashboard also calculates core option Greeks and visualizes the distribution of terminal prices.

---

## Features

 - **Monte Carlo simulation** for European call and put options
 -  **Black-Scholes formula** benchmark for accuracy comparison
 -  **Option Greeks**: Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, Rho
 -  **Interactive histogram** of simulated end prices ($S_T$)
 -  **Downloadable CSV** of simulated prices
 -  **Collapsible sections** for input help and result interpretation

## Option Greeks Explained

| Greek   | Meaning                             |
|---------|-------------------------------------|
| Delta   | Sensitivity to underlying price     |
| Gamma   | Sensitivity of delta                |
| Vega    | Sensitivity to volatility           |
| Theta   | Time decay of the option            |
| Rho     | Sensitivity to interest rate        |

All computed using the Black-Scholes model.
